# Laravel DevOps Lab 🐳🚀

This is a Laravel-based home lab environment designed to simulate a real-world company's DevOps setup.  
The project includes development environment management using Docker, automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions, monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana, and centralized logging with Loki.

## 🧪 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every push to the `dev` branch.

**Pipeline steps:**

1. Checkout code
2. Set up PHP 8.2
3. Install Composer dependencies
4. Generate app key
5. Run tests (if present)
6. ✅ Placeholder for future deployment

You can find the workflow file at:

```
.github/workflows/dev.yml
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Dev Environment

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```

Access:

- Laravel App: http://localhost:8000
- Mailhog UI: http://localhost:8025

---

## 🚀 Running the Staging Environment

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up --build -d
```

Access:

- Laravel App (Staging): http://localhost:8100
- Mailhog (Staging): http://localhost:8125

---

## 🚀 Running the Production Environment

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```

Access:

- Laravel App (Production): https://localhost

> Note: SSL is self-signed. You may get a browser warning.

Inside the container, optimize Laravel:

```bash
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
cp .env.prod .env
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan migrate --force
```

---

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up --build -d
```

Access:

- Laravel App (Staging): http://localhost:8100
- Mailhog (Staging): http://localhost:8125

---

## 📈 Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana + cAdvisor)

```bash
docker compose -f monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
```

- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
- cAdvisor: http://localhost:8080

---

## 🪵 Logging Stack (Loki + Promtail + Grafana)

```bash
docker compose -f monitoring/docker-compose.loki.yml up -d
```

- Explore logs via Grafana → Explore → {job="docker-logs"}

---

## ✅ Healthchecks (All Environments)

Each environment (dev, staging, production) includes Docker Healthchecks for:

- **Laravel App:** HTTP ping on `/`
- **MySQL:** `mysqladmin ping`
- **Redis:** `redis-cli ping`
- **NGINX:** HTTP response check

You can view container status via:

```bash
docker ps
```

Look under the `STATUS` column for `healthy`, `starting`, or `unhealthy`.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add production environment
- Add Runbook (incident handling instructions)
- Add backup script and restore plan
- Add CI/CD deployment to VPS using SSH

---

## 💾 Backup Script

A simple backup script is available in the `scripts/` directory. It exports the MySQL database to a `.sql` file with timestamp.

### Run a manual backup:

```bash
./scripts/backup-db.sh
```

### Output:

Backups are stored in the `backups/` directory, e.g.:

```
backups/backup_2025-05-23_18-50-00.sql
```

## 🔐 Basic Authentication

NGINX in production is secured with Basic Authentication.

To create credentials:

```bash
htpasswd -c docker/nginx/.htpasswd admin
```

Update `default.conf` to include:

```nginx
auth_basic "Restricted Access";
auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
```

Bind the file in `docker-compose.prod.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./docker/nginx/.htpasswd:/etc/nginx/.htpasswd
```

Accessing `https://localhost` will now require a username and password.

## ⚡ Laravel Horizon

Laravel Horizon is included in all environments to manage and monitor queue workers.

### Access

- Dev: http://localhost:8000/horizon
- Staging: http://localhost:8100/horizon
- Prod: https://localhost/horizon (protected)

### Features

- Live stats for queued jobs
- Failed job monitoring
- Redis performance metrics

To access Horizon dashboard:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

Ensure Horizon container is running:

```bash
docker ps | grep horizon
```
